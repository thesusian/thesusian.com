I lied, these are not daily, but who cares.

Started reading PKD's "Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said" since I had it already downloaded on my phone, seems pretty good so far, and it's a nice way to pass time in the metro.

We also have a new project running, a model elevator using the `PIC 16F788` with a remote, for the remote I will be trying to use an `NE555` IC and three push buttons.

Messing around with circuits in Proteus is quite fun.
