Rate Yildiz is now [live on Github](https://github.com/thesusian/rateyildiz.com). I will be making it open-source, mainly because I want free labor. I wanted to upload it on the server today but I can't buy the domain for some reason.

My bad, no update for you this week...

Picked up Disco Elysium again. How can anyone write such an interdependent game, AND record amazing voice lines for almost every interaction!!

Started reading "Notes on the Synthesis of Form", I already read the first two chapters and wrote some notes on it a while ago, now it's a full read.

Accidentally stumbled upon [Galeri Eyüpsultan](https://www.instagram.com/galerieyupsultan), a pleasant surprise. They had some abstract art on display.

Check it out, it's free.

Also, I just finished the PKD's book, it was really good, really really good. I might write something about it.

I lied, these are not daily, but who cares.

Started reading PKD's "Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said" since I had it already downloaded on my phone, seems pretty good so far, and it's a nice way to pass time in the metro.

We also have a new project running, a model elevator using the `PIC 16F788` with a remote, for the remote I will be trying to use an `NE555` IC and three push buttons.

Messing around with circuits in Proteus is quite fun.

This is inspired by [sizeof.cat](https://sizeof.cat/notes), in fact, me making a website at all is somewhat thanks to him too.

Here are some nice pics I took recently.
