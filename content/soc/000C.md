Turns out you can use timers and interrupts, I might write a whole post on the `PIC16F887`, but that's for future me to worry about.

Instead of a weekly post this week I will be writing the post about Rate Yildiz, I think I will stick to a "one post a week" till the end of the year, or unitl I start taking this website seriously.
