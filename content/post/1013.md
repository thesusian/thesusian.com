Things are going great, sadly I'm having to use the Windows VM more and more... Proteus. Nothing worth talking about in university, to be honest.

## Rate Yildiz

In other news I spent half a day trying to get translation to work in FastAPI, mainly because I tried to use [fastapi-babel](https://github.com/Anbarryprojects/fastapi-babel), I don't think it's really the library's fault but I ended up doing it manually. I wrote a small tutorial on how to do [translation with Jinja2](/post/fastapi-translation) since I didn't find anything online on how to do it with Jinja2.
