A boring couple of weeks, not much worth talking about really.

Launch this week? maybe...

In retrospect, I should have finished this thing in a week, specially with Claude's help. The thing actually saved so much time it's unbelievable. A lot of boilerplate code and a lot of simpler stuff it was able to handle flawlessly, and another nice thing is that the codebase was so small (~16K tokens) that I was able to put it all in the context without feeling too bad.

I'm also planning to to make it opensource, I don't really have time to add improvements so maybe other people can contribute.

## Reading

Finished Notes on the Synthesis of Form, it's was a really interesting read. The book mainly talks about how design could (and should) be a logical process, not a purely inuetive one, with practical examples too.
