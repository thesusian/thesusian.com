Nothing much has been happening, I finished up a website I've been making for a client and started preparing for university.

## Rate Yildiz

It's simple really, a website to rate professors and teachers in YTU, the rating will be in three categories.

* English
	* how well they speak English, specially important for international students
* Knowledge
* Friendliness

And you will also be able to make a comment, for now I will be doing manual filtering, but if it gets popular I might automate it with 4o-mini or some other small model. Only verified accounts (using student email) will be able to comment, that should reduce spam quite a bit
