I don't usually do these, mostly because of a fear of failure, I would feel so
stupid for setting goals and not reaching them so I usually just don't set goals - pretty smart, I know - but this year I'm changing things up, or trying to at least

These are mostly goals for this university term but I will just call them 2024 goals because it sounds nicer than "Goals for the second term of my first year in university"

So the things I have going on until the end of the term are:

* Actual university material, which includes
    * Calculus 2
    * Physics 2
    * Programming
    * Material Science
    * Electronic Circuits
* Read about [Deep Learning](https://d2i.ai)
    * I will try to treat this like a normal university course, dedicating time for it
* Read any 3 books, the ones I have in mind
    * Design for Hackers
    * Kingpin
    * Problem Solving with C++

I will *(read: "try to")* be posting weekly updates, what I learned, what I did not learn, and just whatever I feel like since no one is reading this anyway

Over, *tshhhh*
