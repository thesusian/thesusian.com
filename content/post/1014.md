description: Almost done with Rate Yildiz
---

I'm not mad at Proteus, but I can't get over the fact that the "industry standard" looks this outdated, is anybody even using microcontrollers anymore?

## Microcontrollers

Working with the `PIC16F887` seems straight forward, it's just a dumber Arduino.
It feels like in order to program these things you have to keep so much in context, and to keep referencing the datasheet, I started writing some notes on each port and how to do things in assembly and C, would be nice if there was a website that would just summerize the datasheet and give you an interactive preview of the microcontroller, where you could see visually what each pin is used for.

## Rate Yildiz

I'm done with the core functionality, the rest are mostly just UI issues, here is the to-do list if you are interested:

* block the user if they enter too many wrong verification codes
* fix footer placment
* favicon, sitemap, robots.txt
* stars
* better search, replace Turkish letters for English and visa versa
* fix leaderboard on mobile
* add leaderboards for each faculty
* the website *looks* bad, fix it

There are other things that can be improved but I probably would never bother with, these include:

* caching the images because avesis is so slow
* reporting comments
* auto-mod using 4o-mini (I might have to do this if the website takes off :/)
* liking or disliking comments to give them more or less weight
* different weights for verified and non-verified ratings
* ability to reveal your name on comments
* etc...
