Well, I gave up, I'm switching to Hugo

## Why?

Well, my small script just wasn't good enough, and hoestly I would rather have some solid framework to write one.

This way I will be able to more easily use tags in my posts, and I will have a lot of quality-of-life features that I couldn't bother to implement in my old website, thigs like `print("better inline code")` and

```C
printf("better normal code blocks");
```

```python
class That(can):
    work = with(different.langauges)
```

The theme I'm using is a modified version of [hugo-texify2-mod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-texify2/), mostly changing fonts and colors. It still looks barebones at the moment, I might change it, I might not, haven't decided yet.

## And?

Yeah, I guess that's it, I'm hoping that by making this change I would encorage myself to wrtie more here, even if it was non-techincal stuff for fun.

## Robot?

You can find more about it [on my account on X the everything app](https://x.com/thesusian/status/1808172163762987422), and I wrote a [small post about it](/post/rcb-001)
