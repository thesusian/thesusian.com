I'm thinking of redesigning the website, I don't really like the way it looks right now

## Redesign?

There are something that I know have to be there

* Light mode, or dark and light, but I dislike websites with just a dark mode, unless it's really good
* A nice place to put my projects
* A place to write about random stuff (like this)
* A [social/updates](/soc) section

I'm not sure about the direction I should take this, I'm between an nice serif font and a monospace hacky font, you can imagine what I mean.

 Websites like [sonnet.io](https://sonnet.io/) - he also has a [nice blog](https://untested.sonnet.io/) - make nice use of a clean serif font, others like [Ratfactor](https://ratfactor.com/) have an interesting [cards](https://ratfactor.com/cards/) system, which are;

> A collection of short, interconnected notes.
> It is intentionally sprawling and incomplete. There will be dead ends. It may or may not be of use to others.

But what I think I'm looking for is something in the intersection between both worlds, something between these.

## Rate Yildiz

I still haven't shared rateyildiz with other students in the university, at least not fully, I want to clean up the Github repo a bit more before sharing it, but after I do that I'm not planning on doing anything more with it, other than approving and testing PRs (if any) and maintaining the thing. I will be keeping the site up until the domain expires, then I will decide if it's worth keeping, depending on how much traction it gets.

## Next Project

I'm busy for the week; exams. But next week I have no exams, and I have no running project, so what am I to do?

Right now I have a few projects on my mind, the first would be a simple robotic arm to do some research on, I recently picked up 'Analytical Robotics and Mechatronics' by Wolfram Stadler (admittedly not the best time) and I want to try trajectory planning and object avoidance in a real-life setting. The other project is a small finance app, just for fun, mainly because I couldn't find a decent app that I actually liked, and now with LLMs making your own app has never been easier.

So yeah, that's it.
