## About
	
Good evening, I'm Mohammad Alsoussi, a student living in Istanbul, it's a bit cloudy at the moment.
	
My life is not terribly interesting, I was born in Jordan then I moved to Istanbul, my dad introduced me to computers when I was 12ish, but I never realized how much power an etched piece of silicone holds until recently.
	
I found the list of things I'm good at to be too long, so here is a list of things I'm *not* good at, because otherwise we would go on for millions of lines and your computer would probably crash.
	
* Things I'm not good at
		* Sports
		* Making popcorn
		* Biology
		* Quantum physics (working on this, will remove soon)
	
But generally I'm more interested in computers, and recently robotics (since I started studding mechatronics eng), I program mainly in C++ and Python (flask is really good), I'm not that good at either, but things always figure themselves out (I'm just really good at Googling stuff, this and reading some essays about programming philosophy is all you need), you can see some examples on my [Github](https://github.com/thesusian).

I also dabbled a bit in cyber security, I did some capture the flag competitions with my team [SQLKinkjection](https://ctftime.org/team/197263) (previously [N00bsCTF](https://ctftime.org/team/165889)) and it's quite fun, I still do CTFs from time to time.

## Contact

If you want to message me you can use my [X account](https://x.com/thesusian) or send me an email on my [personal email](mailto:thesusian@riseup.net). And finally here is my obligatory [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thesusian/), I don't really use it but it exists, if you care.

## Now

Now I'm working on a small robot arm, which I plan to make into a full humanoid robot, you can [check out the progress here](/tags/rcb/).
